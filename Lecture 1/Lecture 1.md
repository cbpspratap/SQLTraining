# Understand The Basics:
- Why SQL?

Everyone knows that data is the new oil and on daily basis currently we create roughly 2.5 quintillion bytes of data [*(source)*](https://seedscientific.com/how-much-data-is-created-every-day/#:~:text=Every%20day%2C%20we%20create%20roughly%202.5%20quintillion%20bytes%20of%20data.). Just imagine the scale on which the data is being processed, stored and used. In current marked condition no business can run without data, first they need data to get their website running and then the website/business will start generating data which they again need to store somewhere. And once the data is stored in a database you need SQL to extract meaningful information out of the data.

Without SQL, almost no meaningful online service could exist - from bank to grocerry delivery, everything runs on data. Despite the passage of years, SQL is still the primary computer language when you talk about data. In current job market for data, almost every job requires SQL skills.


- What is SQL?

SQL stand for Structured Query Language. As per Britanica SQL is a computer language designed for eliciting information from databases(it includes database creation, deletion, fetching rows, modifying rows, etc).

In the 1970s computer scientists began developing a standardized way to manipulate databases, and out of that research came SQL. SQL gained popularity when the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) adopted the first SQL standard in 1986. Some large software companies, such as Microsoft Corporation and Oracle Corporation, produced their own versions of SQL, and an open-source version, MySQL, became extremely popular.

- What is Database & DBMS?

A database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically. If you are storing some of your data in Excel that can also be called a database, but in real life scenario the data is really huge and there are specific electronic systems built to store this data. These databases are designed specifically for the purpose of how it will be used. In some cases the data is stored in logical tables(row & column format) and they are called relation database while in some cases it is stored in non-tabular format(key value pair) which is called No SQL Database.

A database management system (or DBMS) is essentially nothing more than a computerized system or software which help manage the database. You can call a DBMS as the interface betwwen human and data, the primary goal of a DBMS is to provide an environment that is both convenient and efficient to use in retrieving and storing data base information and same time maintaining the security of the data.
