# Run SQL Statements

In this chapter we will get into a bit of hands-on SQL coding, we will write basic SQL statements and will observe the output or the result and then will try to understand the working of a SQL statement.

We will take a use case where we will create a dpu_college database and within this database we will create 3 tables student, dept and faculty.

  ***DB:*** *dpu_college*

  ***Table:*** *student, dept, faculty*


### Create  Database

To create *dpu_college* database(db) we will use CREATE command which is basically a DDL command. Remember that in case of MySQL database is same as schema and it can be used interchangeably.

**Syntax:**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
```

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE dpu_college;
```
